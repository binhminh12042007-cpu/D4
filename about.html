        <h1>About</h1>
        
        <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
        <p>DNA ME began with a simple question: Why do people respond so differently to the same demands, the same stress, the same classroom, the same expectations?</p>
        <p>Some students thrive late at night, some shut down under pressure. Some crave novelty, while others seek stability. Rather than treating these differences as weaknesses or personality flaws, DNA ME approaches them as expressions of underlying biology. We believe self-awareness involves understanding the systems that quietly shape how we think, feel, learn, and adapt.</p>
        
        <h2>WHAT DNA ME IS AND ISN'T</h2>
        <p>DNA ME is not a genetic test.</p>
        <p> We do not sequence DNA or diagnose conditions.</p>
        <p>Instead, DNA ME is a biologically informed behavioral profiling framework designed to help young people recognize how biological mechanisms such as circadian rhythm, stress hormones, and dopamine regulation express themselves through everyday habits and choices.</p>
        
        <h2>THE SCIENCE BEHIND DNA ME</h2>
        <p>DNA ME is grounded in research from neuroscience, behavioral biology, and psychology, including studies on:</p>
        <p>Circadian rhythm genes (PER2, PER3, CRY1) and chronotype variation</p>
        <br>
        <p>Cortisol regulation and emotional stress responses</p>
        <br>
        <p>Dopamine pathways (DRD4) and novelty-seeking behavior</p>
        <br>
        <p>Multimodal learning strategies.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hormonal responses to stress-related eating behaviors</p>
        <br>
        <p>Rather than isolating these factors, DNA ME integrates them into a multi-dimensional biological behavioral profile, reflecting how real human systems interact.</p>
        <p>All quiz domains are designed with scientific caution, which means that results emphasize only tendencies, not determinism, and are framed for educational and reflective purposes only.</p>
        
        <h2>WHY DO WE CREATE DNA ME?</h2>
        <p>Many young people are taught what to achieve, but not how their minds and bodies actually work.</p>
        <p>DNA ME helps users:</p>
        <p>Align study habits with natural energy cycles</p>
        <br>
        <p>Recognize stress patterns before burnout occurs</p>
        <br>
        <p>Channel curiosity and motivation more effectively</p>
        <br>
        <p>Develop self-compassion through biological understanding</p>
        <p>Biology influences behavior, but does not define destiny, which means that understanding your tendencies creates room for growth. We hope that by designing habits, environments, and goal suggestions, it can help support your development.</p>
        
        <h2>A NOTE ON ETHICS & RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
        <p>DNA ME is built with care and restraint.</p>
        <p>It does not offer medical advice</p>
        <br>
        <p>It avoids rigid labeling</p>
        <br>
        <p>It prioritizes education, reflection, and autonomy</p>
        <br>
        <p>All results are presented as guidance, not conclusions.</p>
        
        <h2>LOOKING FORWARD</h2>
        <p>DNA ME is an evolving project under Bookdeuniverse, developed by students passionate about science. Our long-term vision is to expand DNA ME into a platform that helps young people navigate learning, mental well-being, and personal growth through science-informed insight.</p>
        
        <h2>CLOSING</h2>
        <p>" Understanding yourself is not about becoming someone else.</p>
        <p> It's about learning how to grow from where you already are."</p>
